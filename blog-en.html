                    <p>
                        Morning on Bjelašnica has a clear, glassy silence you notice only when you stop and
                        rest your palm on the cold trail railing. Soft orange light spills over the peaks
                        while the valley still sleeps, and the mountain breathes slowly and deeply. No rush,
                        no noise — just the wind in the pines and the distant crunch of snow underfoot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We started slowly, through the forest’s half‑shade, where the scent of resin mixed
                        with clean air fills your lungs like a first breath. The trail was quiet, and each
                        step sounded like a soft whisper. Between the trees, morning rays painted long stripes
                        on the ground, and it felt as if we were walking through light, not through the woods.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the open stretch, the view suddenly widens — a chain of peaks, a calm valley, and
                        thin bands of mist slowly pulling back like a curtain. That’s when you understand why
                        people come here to find calm: the space is vast, and thoughts fall into place on their
                        own. You hear your breathing, the rhythm of your steps, and feel the cold air refresh
                        your face.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the viewpoint we paused for warm tea. The sun was already high, yet the mountain
                        kept its morning coolness. Bjelašnica doesn’t ask for much — just a little attention
                        and respect — and in return it gives the feeling that, if only briefly, you are part
                        of something calm and enduring.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you plan this route, bring layers and start early. The morning light here is short,
                        but it leaves a long trace in memory.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Silence on Durmitor is not emptiness, but presence. You feel it in the blue of Black
                        Lake, in the calm mirror of the water, and in the soft rustle of grass when the wind
                        passes over the meadows. Here, morning doesn’t announce itself loudly — it spreads
                        slowly through the mist, as if the mountain doesn’t want to disturb its own peace.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The path by the lake leads gently, without hurry. At every step you see a different
                        reflection — peaks, clouds, pines, and an occasional bird flying low. Beyond the first
                        bend, the silence grows deeper: steps soften, thoughts quiet. It feels like the mountain
                        asks you to slow down, to listen, and to let the day arrange itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At one point, where the trail turns toward the forest, the air turns cooler and the
                        scent of earth grows stronger. That’s the moment you realize you are far from everything,
                        yet that distance doesn’t feel heavy — on the contrary, it feels light and clean.
                        Durmitor has that gift: to pull you away from noise and closer to yourself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the sun rises, colors sharpen and stone and grass gain clear lines. Still, the
                        silence remains. There is no need to speak; it’s enough to sit on a rock, open a
                        thermos, and listen to the wind. In that moment, Durmitor becomes more than a landscape
                        — it becomes a feeling.
                    </p>

                        If you want this kind of experience, come in early autumn or toward the end of summer.
                        Then the crowds are smaller, the light softer, and the silence deeper.
